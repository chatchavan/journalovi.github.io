See **TODO** for guidance and a template for the abstract.\n\n## Setting up and writing a JoVI article\n\nJoVI articles are written in Quarto, which is a simple markdown-based text format. This template outlines some of the features that are most useful for writing academic articles in Quarto; for more visit <https://quarto.org>.\n\nYou can find the source for this article in the [journalovi/jovi-template-quarto](https://github.com/journalovi/jovi-template-quarto) repository on Github. To create a new JoVI article, we recommend following these steps:\n\n1.  Install Quarto by following [these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html).\n\n2.  Create a new git repository to hold your article by [forking our template repository](https://github.com/journalovi/jovi-template-quarto).\n\nYou can then edit `index.qmd` in your new repository to write your paper. There are several options for editing and rendering the paper:\n\n1.  You can execute `quarto serve` from the commandline to render the paper to `index.html` and preview it in the browser.\n\n2.  You can edit the paper in RStudio and render it by clicking on the *Render* button: ![](images/rstudio-render-button.png){style=\"max-width: 382.5px\" fig.alt=\"Click Render in the Rstudio toolbar to render a Quarto document.\"}\n\n**If you plan to use RStudio,** read more about RStudio and Quarto [here](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/using-rstudio.html). In particular, you should install RStudio \\> version 1.5, which as of this writing requires installing the [latest \"daily\" version of RStudio](https://dailies.rstudio.com/). If you do, you can also enable the visual editor:\n\n![](images/rstudio-visual-editor.png){style=\"max-width: 554.5px\" fig.alt=\"Click the Settings button and then Use Visual Editor in the Rstudio toolbar to enable the visual editor.\"}\n\n## Citations and footnotes\n\nCitations can be inserted using `[@simkin2002read]`; e.g. \\[@simkin2002read\\]. Citations for this paper are kept in `bibliography.bib` in BibTeX format.[^1] For more on footnotes and citations see [this Quarto documentation page](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html).\n\n[^1]: You can also insert footnotes!\n\n## Figures and images\n\nImages can be included and for accessibility purposes **should always** have alt text. Alt text of visualizations should provide meaningful descriptions of the visualization.\n\n``` markdown\n![](images/teaser.svg){fig.alt=\"Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions,\nshowing an increase over time in most conditions, with dot50 having the highest value of\napproximately 97% of optimal.\"}\n```\n\n![](images/teaser.svg){fig.alt=\"Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions, showing an increase over time in most conditions, with dot50 having the highest value of approximately 97% of optimal.\"}\n\nYou can also add captions and figure references using a `:::` block combined with an id prefixed with `#fig-`:\n\n``` markdown\n:::\n![](images/teaser.svg){fig.alt=\"Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions,\nshowing an increase over time in most conditions, with dot50 having the highest value of\napproximately 97% of optimal.\"}\n\nMean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions.\n:::\n```\n\n::: {#fig-teaser}\n![](images/teaser.svg){fig.alt=\"Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions, showing an increase over time in most conditions, with dot50 having the highest value of approximately 97% of optimal.\"}\n\nMean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions.\n:::\n\nThen you can refer to the above figure in text using `@fig-teaser`; for example:\n\nRefer to @fig-teaser. For the highest-quality output, we recommend using SVG figures if possible.\n\nQuarto also supports more complex figure layouts and subfigures; see [the Quarto page on figures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures-and-layout.html). For more on cross-references, see the [Quarto page on cross-references](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html).\n\n## Code\n\nQuarto supports R and python code; for example:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n## Equations\n\nEquations can be included using LaTeX syntax:\n\n$$\nx=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\n$$\n\nFor more on equations, see [the corresponding section in the Quarto documentation]().",
