# JoVI Newsletter - Summer 2023

Dear colleagues,

The summer break is winding down, and we would like to give you an update about what's going on at our new Journal of Visualization and Interaction.

First of all, we have our very first submission for the experimental track currently being reviewed. As the experimental track also exists to _experiment_
with open reviews (among other things), you can follow the process along at [Github][1]. The interactive article draft can also be found online at [our website][2].

In addition, we have agreed with two external academic venues, namely the [VISxAI workshop at IEEE VIS 2023][3], and the [Information+ Conference 2023][4], to act as
publication venue for the extended versions of their proceedings. These articles will be subject to the same openness requirements as other JoVI submissions,
and will go through a second round of reviews before being accepted into the corresponding special issue.

If you have further questions about JoVI, feel free to contact us via [email](mailto:submit@journalovi.org), join our [Transparent Research Slack channel][5], or ping us on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/journalovi) and [Mastodon](https://hci.social/@jovi).

Best regards, the JoVI editorial team
(Lonni, Florian, Matt, and Chat)
