This template outlines some of the features that are most useful for writing academic articles in Quarto; for more visit https://quarto.org.\nYou can find the source for this article in the journalovi/jovi-template-quarto repository on Github. To create a new JoVI article, we recommend following these steps:\n\nInstall Quarto by following these instructions.\nCreate a new git repository to hold your article by forking our template repository.\n\nYou can then edit index.qmd in your new repository to write your paper. There are several options for editing and rendering the paper:\n\nYou can execute quarto serve from the commandline to render the paper to index.html and preview it in the browser.\nYou can edit the paper in RStudio and render it by clicking on the Render button: \n\nIf you plan to use RStudio, read more about RStudio and Quarto here. In particular, you should install RStudio > version 1.5, which as of this writing requires installing the latest “daily” version of RStudio. If you do, you can also enable the visual editor:"

A public apology may be requested. Editors may require that the language of a review or response be changed before allowing the message to proceed to other parties.\n\n\n2. Warning\nCommunity Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.\nConsequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.\n\n\n3. Temporary Ban\nCommunity Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.\nConsequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n\n\n4. Permanent Ban\nCommunity Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\nConsequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community."

Submitted manuscripts must link to all raw data and replication material for any empirical components, all reproducibility code for any analysis or computational component, and all other relevant research material (such as software code, interview protocols, and preregistrations – [link to policy page]).

Reviews aim to evaluate the credibility of a manuscript’s claims and the clarity of its evidence rather than reviewer preference. Registered reports, the submission of study plans prior to data collection, are therefore strongly encouraged by JoVI."

    "text": "JoVI respects the time and effort of both authors and reviewers. Authors can expect that their submissions will not be rejected over easily fixable technicalities. An editor will check the initial submission for obvious problems and allow authors to update it before the review process if necessary. Also, initial submissions to JoVI have flexible formatting requirements, meaning authors accustomed to other formats will only need to make minor changes before submitting. Authors can even submit a preprint DOI instead of uploading the submission. One difference about JoVI articles is the [structured abstract], which is intended to clearly communicate to reviewers and readers what the contributions, methods, and conclusions are at the start."

    "text": "JoVI aims for a collaborative, humane review process. Reviewing is implemented as a (potentially anonymous) discussion between the authors and the reviewers rather than a one-sided argument about whether to accept or reject a manuscript. To start a review conversation, the editor posts the reviews as the beginning of discussion threads. The conversation proceeds as a back and forth around each review between authors, reviewers, and any other interested parties with the goal of improving the work."

All submitted work, reviews, and discussions will be publicly available for other researchers to use. Manuscripts that have successfully addressed all the issues raised by the reviewers and editorial team are considered “endorsed” by the editor and approving reviewers, not “accepted”** by the JoVI. To encourage accountability, editors’ names are listed on the articles they endorse, and reviewers may choose to be named or anonymous**. As articles are living documents, which versions have received endorsements are clearly indicated with the article. All submissions and their accompanying reviews and discussions remain accessible whether or not an article secures an endorsement or is retracted."

The journal strives to maintain an editorial board with diverse representation in terms of gender and gender expression, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, ability, geographic location, and affiliation. We value diversity as an empowering force that leads to better, more innovative, and more impactful research. We commit to DEI by requiring editors, authors, and reviewers to follow our [code of conduct], and any who do not do so will lose the opportunity to review for or contribute to JoVI in the future. Part of our commitment also involves being sensitive to contributors at different stages of their careers; as such, we allow reviewers to review anonymously and authors to opt for anonymity prior to the first endorsement. We also strive for all endorsed articles to be accessible to people of different abilities."
